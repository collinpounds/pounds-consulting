# Pounds Consulting Pitch Deck Content

## Slide 1: Opening Hook

**Your Technology Should Work for You. Not the Other Way Around.**

You started a business to solve problems, serve customers, and build something meaningful.

Not to debug websites at midnight. Not to wonder if your developer ghosted you. Not to sit through meetings full of jargon that doesn't translate to results.

There's a better way.

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Most Businesses Get Burned by Tech**

Here's what I hear from business owners every week:

- "I paid $15,000 for a website that doesn't show up on Google."
- "My developer disappeared halfway through the project."
- "I have five different tools that don't talk to each other."
- "I don't know if I need an app or a website or both."
- "Everyone's telling me I need AI, but I don't know where to start."

Sound familiar?

The tech industry has a trust problem. Too many agencies overpromise, underdeliver, and bill you for their learning curve.

## Slide 3: A Different Approach

**What If You Had a Technical Partner Instead of a Vendor?**

Vendors sell you things. Partners solve your problems.

I'm Collin Pounds, founder of Pounds Consulting. I started this company because I saw too many good businesses get bad advice.

My approach is simple: I treat your business like my business. That means honest conversations about what you actually need, not what sounds impressive. It means showing up when I say I will. And it means building things that last, not things that need constant fixing.

## Slide 4: About Me

**5 Years Building Software That Matters**

I've spent my career at the intersection of technology and business:

**Paytient** - Healthcare fintech serving hundreds of thousands of users. I led a team of six engineers implementing multi-factor authentication and redesigned the onboarding flow to reduce drop-offs.

**Club Car Wash** - Built their public website, employee portal, and ran Google Ads campaigns supporting 3+ new store openings per month for over a year.

**AT&T** - Enterprise-level operations in Indianapolis.

Plus dozens of small businesses, startups, and service companies across Missouri and beyond.

I have a Computer Science degree from the University of Missouri. I know how the technology works, and I know how to explain it without the jargon.

## Slide 5: What We Do

**Four Ways We Help**

**Website Development**
Fast, professional websites that actually convert visitors into customers. Mobile-responsive, SEO-optimized, built to load in under 2 seconds. No templates dressed up as custom work.

**Digital Marketing Systems**
Email campaigns, SMS outreach, appointment scheduling, lead capture. The systems that turn one-time visitors into repeat customers.

**Technical Strategy**
Before you spend money, let's make sure you're spending it on the right thing. Technology assessments, vendor evaluations, build vs. buy decisions. Honest advice that saves you from expensive mistakes.

**Business Solutions**
Connect your tools. Automate the repetitive stuff. Fix what's broken. Custom integrations that save hours every week.

## Slide 6: The Network Advantage

**One Point of Contact. A Team Behind the Scenes.**

Here's something most solo consultants won't tell you: nobody knows everything.

I've spent years building relationships with brilliant specialists across every discipline. Designers. Security experts. Data scientists. Mobile developers. Marketing strategists.

When your project needs expertise I don't have, I bring in the right person. You still get one point of contact, one relationship, one person accountable for results. But you also get access to talent you'd never find on your own.

No project is out of reach. Whatever the challenge, someone in my network has solved it before.

## Slide 7: Why Clients Choose Us

**We Do Things Differently**

**We keep it simple.**
Every recommendation is based on what works, not what sounds impressive. If a $500 solution does the job, I'm not going to sell you a $50,000 solution.

**We show up.**
I answer emails. I meet deadlines. I tell you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. You'll never wonder where your project stands.

**We build things that last.**
No duct tape solutions. No "we'll fix that later." Clean work that you can hand off to any developer five years from now and they'll understand what they're looking at.

**We speak your language.**
I can explain technical concepts to your board and technical architecture to your engineers. No translation needed.

---

## Slide 8: Real Results

**Work That Speaks for Itself**

A few examples:

**Paytient** - Simplified onboarding flow, redesigned member portal, led MFA implementation for a platform serving hundreds of thousands of healthcare users.

**Club Car Wash** - Complete digital presence supporting rapid expansion. Website, employee portal, and ad campaigns for 36+ store openings.

**Old Hawthorne Country Club** - Modernized an outdated website with targeted improvements that respected their existing investment.

**Gracie Humaita Columbia** - Full website build with class scheduling, membership information, and instructor profiles.

Every project delivered on time. Every client still reachable if you want a reference.

## Slide 9: How We Work Together

**Simple Process. No Surprises.**

**1. Discovery Call (Free)**
30 minutes to understand your situation. No pitch, no pressure. Just a conversation about what you're trying to accomplish and whether I can help.

**2. Proposal**
If we're a good fit, you get a clear scope, timeline, and price. No hidden fees. No scope creep surprises.

**3. Build**
Regular updates. Working demos. You're never in the dark about progress.

**4. Launch & Support**
We don't disappear after launch. Questions come up. Things need adjusting. I'm here.

---

## Slide 10: Pricing

**Transparent. Simple. Fair.**

**Hourly Rate: $100/hour**

No retainers required. No minimum commitments. You pay for work completed.

For larger projects, I provide fixed-price quotes so you know exactly what you're investing before we start.

**Discovery calls are always free.** If I'm not the right fit for your project, I'll tell you and point you in the right direction.

---

## Slide 11: Who This Is For

**We Work Best With:**

- Business owners who want a technical partner, not just a vendor
- Growing companies that need systems to scale
- Service businesses ready to stop losing leads to a slow website
- Founders who've been burned before and want someone they can trust
- Teams that need technical expertise without hiring full-time

**We're probably not the right fit if:**

- You want the cheapest option (I'm not it, and cheap usually costs more in the long run)
- You need a full-time employee (I can help you hire one though)
- You want someone to just do what you say without pushback (I'll tell you when I think you're wrong)

---

## Slide 12: Let's Talk

**Ready to Stop Fighting Your Technology?**

Book a free 30-minute discovery call. No pitch, no pressure. Just a conversation about what you're building and how I might be able to help.

## Optional Slide: AI Services Spotlight

**AI Without the Noise**

Everyone's talking about AI. Most of it is empty promises.

Here's the truth: AI can be genuinely useful for your business, but only if you start with a real problem, not a technology looking for a purpose.

I help businesses:
- Identify where AI creates genuine value (and where it's just expensive novelty)
- Implement practical solutions using tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and custom models
- Build AI-powered automations that save real hours every week
- Avoid the 85% of AI projects that fail to deliver results

Computer Science degree. Hands-on implementation experience. No buzzwords.

If you're curious about AI but skeptical of the promises, we should talk.
