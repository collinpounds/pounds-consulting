## Hero Section

### H1
Built on Experience, Driven by Results

### Subheadline
Pounds Consulting was founded on a simple idea: people deserve technical partners who actually understand their problems.

---

## Story Section

### H2

### Body
Before this, I spent 4 years at Paytient, a technology company at THE crossroad of healthcare and finance, where I worked my way from product support to leading technical product initiatives. I've evaluated identity verification platforms, managed complex software roadmaps, and helped develop software and financial products used by hundreds of thousands of people.

Along the way, I learned something important: most technical problems aren't actually that complicated. They just need someone willing to listen, apply common sense, and have agency without overcomplicating things.

So that's what I do now. I help businesses build websites, solve technical challenges, and make better decisions about technology. I keep things simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. No massive team. Just direct access to someone who's done the work and knows how to get it completed quickly and exceeding high expectations.

- Collin P.
